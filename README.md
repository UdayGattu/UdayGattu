# Uday Shankar Gattu | AI Systems Architect

**High-Throughput Inference | Agentic Workflows | Distributed Systems**

I do not just wrap APIs. I architect scalable AI systems that handle production loads. My focus is purely on reducing inference latency (P99), optimizing GPU memory utilization, and orchestrating multi-agent systems that actually work in production environments, not just Jupyter notebooks.

## 🚀 Featured Engineering

### [BrandAI: Multi-Agent Marketing Orchestrator](https://github.com/BrandTrustAI/BrandAI)
*Architected a distributed agentic system to automate end-to-end video content generation.*
* Engineered a LangGraph state machine orchestrating 4 autonomous agents, reducing manual content workflow time by 40% through parallelized execution.
* Integrated Google Veo 3.1 for high-fidelity Image-to-Video generation, optimizing API payload handling to maintain sub-200ms overhead during spikes.

### [A.R.G.U.S.: Automated Red-Teaming Graph](https://github.com/TestingSoftwareAI/ARGUS)
*Developed an adversarial security suite to stress-test LLM safety alignment.*
* Built an automated injection pipeline detecting 15+ distinct vector types, effectively improving model safety compliance scores by 25% in pre-deployment audits.
* Implemented a recursive critique loop using dual-LLM evaluation to reduce false positive security flags by 18% compared to standard keyword matching.

### [TextToVideo: Distributed Media Pipeline](https://github.com/GenAIByUdayGattu/TextToVideo)
*High-performance rendering pipeline for generative media.*
* Deployed asynchronous worker queues on GCP to render 1080p video from text prompts, optimizing GPU VRAM usage by 30% via dynamic quantization techniques.
